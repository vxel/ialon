/**
 *  Sorts geometry based on an included "layer" user data,
 *  accumulating an effective layer by walking up the
 *  scene graph back to root.  Layers are parent-local layers
 *  and not global layers.  In other words, they only control
 *  the sorting of children.  This approach is more useful in
 *  a GUI environment where UI elements are grouped in
 *  scene graph hierarchies already.
